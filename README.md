# Snake Game 🎮🐍
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, built using Python's **`turtle` module**. The game allows you to control a snake, eat food, and increase your score as the snake grows longer. The game ends when the snake collides with its own body or the boundary.
## Features ✨
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Control the snake using arrow keys.
- **Scoreboard**: Keeps track of your score during the game.
- **Snake Growth**: The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- **Collision Detection**:
    - Game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own tail.

- **Random Food Placement**: Food is placed at random positions on the screen.

## Installation 🛠️
Follow the steps below to set up and play the game on your local machine:
1. **Clone the repository**:
``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
```
1. **Ensure Python 3.x is installed**:
The code is compatible with Python 3.8 or later.
2. **Install Python's `turtle` module** (included by default). If not installed:
``` bash
   pip install PythonTurtle
```
## How to Play 🕹️
1. Run the game:
``` bash
   python snake_game_simulation.py
```
1. Use the following **Arrow Keys** to control the snake:
    - **Up Arrow**: Move up
    - **Down Arrow**: Move down
    - **Left Arrow**: Move left
    - **Right Arrow**: Move right

2. Objective:
    - Eat the blue circle-shaped food to grow the snake and increase your score.
    - Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

3. **Game Over**: If the snake hits the wall or its body, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

## Game Mechanics ⚙️
### 1. **Snake** 🐍
- The `Snake` class manages the movement and appearance of the snake.
- The snake is represented by a list of square-shaped **Turtle** objects.

### 2. **Food** 🍎
- The `Food` class represents the food that the snake eats.
- Each time the snake eats, the food is teleported to a random position on the game screen.

### 3. **Scoreboard** 🏆
- The `Scoreboard` class manages the score and displays it at the top of the screen.
- Upon game over, it displays a "GAME OVER" message.

### 4. **Collisions**
- If the snake's head moves out of bounds (walls) or collides with its own body, the game ends.

## Preview 🖼️
### Initial Screen
The game begins with the snake in the center of the screen, a scoreboard at the top, and a randomly placed food item.
### Gameplay
